     Calculate the fuel efficiency of a vehicle
 
   Keyboard inputs:
     Vehicle description (string)
     Miles traveled (int)
     Fuel used in gallons (double)
 
   Outputs:
     Miles per gallon

  The starter file calculates the fuel efficiency of a vehicle in MPG (miles per gallon), a
    quantity commonly used in the US. In much of the rest of the world, fuel efficiency is
    often reported in L/100km (liters per 100 kilometers)

 
  Your task

    Extend the starter file to calculate both measures—MPG and L/100km—for the given
    user input.
    The starter file includes a constant for KM_PER_MILE which you must use in your
    calculation; you must also add a new constant for LITERS_PER_GALLON (you may need
    to use Google to find the correct conversion factor to use). Add appropriate constant(s),
    variable(s), assignment statement(s), and print statement(s) to the program to
    generate correct and understandable output. An example will be shown in class.
 

    For up to +2 points extra credit, format the output values to have exactly two digits to
    the right of the decimal place.
